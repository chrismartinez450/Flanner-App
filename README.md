# FlannerApp
A app that allows students to create and manage events in a calendar with highlighted dates to show the events are on that specific date. A study tracker or "Focus Timer" that allows students to input a subject that they are studying for and set a timer for how long they want to study. The time that students study for with the Focus Timer is then tracked in the study tracker which allows students to track their studying for each of subjects they studied for and see the time that was spent on each subject.  Users will create an account through Flanner or can use a google account.
